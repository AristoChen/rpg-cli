# rpg-cli â€”Your filesystem as a dungeon!

rpg-cli is a bare-bones [JRPG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JRPG)-inspired terminal game written in Rust. It can work as an alias to `cd` where you randomly encounter enemies as you change directories.

## Install from source

To install from source (assuming Cargo is available):
